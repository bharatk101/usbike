# [US Bikeshare Data](https://www.motivateco.com) 


Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. 
Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. 
This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it to point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. 
Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

This project is part of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.

In this project, I will use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns.
